                I'm Evan Janakievski, currently a student at the University of
                Waterloo, majoring in Mechatronics Engineering. It was important
                to me to have an education with a strong interdisciplinary,
                didactic program combined with hands-on learning and it is why I
                selected the University of Waterloo, along with its renowned
                co-op program. As a first-year student, I understand that I have
                a lot to learn, but I believe that my curriculum and
                extracurriculars will prepare me to be an asset in any position
                I hold.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Technology has always fascinated me, and I'm continually eager
                to broaden my knowledge through different opportunities.
                Mechanical design, robotics, automation, and software captivate
                my interest. While I am not focusing on school, I like to pursue
                personal projects to develop hands-on skills in any field that
                draws my interest!
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                My other interests include soccer, tennis, Formula 1, scuba
                diving, and rock climbing! I also enjoy traveling with my
                family, cooking, and baking. Photography is something I am
                slowly getting introduced to, and I love viewing beautiful
                landscapes.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                I am always open to new opportunities and challenges, so feel
                free to reach out to me at{" "}
